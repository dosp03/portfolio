            <h3 class="overlined"> Developing the Brand Concept</h3>
            <h3> The Idea </h3>

            <p>
                At the start of our project we were in the position of a founding team with the task was to develop the idea for a brand from scratch,
                so we used brainstorming to find a promising business niche and a business concept that does not exist yet.
            </p>

            <p style="padding-top: 8px;">
                The idea of “Greenergym” emerged from recognizing the separate nature of two trends: Fitness and environmental protection - despite their potential for synergy. 
                People increasingly desire an active lifestyle while also showing a growing 
                inclination towards environmental consciousness. 
                From our own experience and further research, we realized that traditional fitness studios often lack sustainability practices, 
                generating evitable waste and using non-biodegradable materials. 
            </p>
            <p style="padding-top: 8px;">
                Our brand however, is meant to be a self-sufficient system that provides a holistic and eco-friendly fitness experience, minimizes dependence on external resources
                and only uses sustainable and fair-trade ingredients, materials, and energy sources.
                This is achieved by the brand consisting of three interconnected sub-brands:  GreenerGym, GreenerFoods, and GreenerWear. 
            </p>
            <p style="padding-top: 8px;">
                Based on this initial idea, the business concept was developed in detail.

                            focuses on providing an eco-friendly fitness experience. It is the heart of the Fitnessmall where all the sport-activities take place.
                            GreenerGym ensures that all training equipment is made from sustainable and recyclable materials, free from harmful substances and plastics. 
                            Using high-quality, durable materials like stainless steel, iron, and solid wood instead of plastic <span class="more" style="display: none;">,and generating electricity by harnessing the power generated by their cardio equipment, 
                            which is then used to operate the fitness mall, are part of their 
                            environmentally friendly self-sustainability concept. 
                            In addition Greenergym offers a mobile app that allows users to track their workouts and earn rewards for generating electricity.

                            To include options for every preference, they offer vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free alternatives.
                            Greenergym grows their own vegetables and fruits in an enclosed area of their outdoor space, which are freshly harvested 
                            and used in the delicious and nutritious GreenerFoods dishes. <span class="more" style="display: none;">While not all ingredients can be sourced
                            from their own cultivation due to seasonal variations, Greenergym ensures that the rest of the ingredients are obtained 
                            from organic and regional sources. They also partner with sustainable snack manufacturers to reduce packaging and

            <p>
                Greenergym is a youthful and forward-thinking company that focuses 
                on attracting young, environmentally conscious individuals aged 20-35. 
                They are urban dwellers who actively participate in social activities and 
                embrace digital connectivity. These individuals prioritize personal growth, 
                sustainability, and health, falling into two categories: 
                the expeditive and the neo-ecological milieu. 
                Greenergym engages them through fitness, environmental passion, digital affinity, 
                and innovative offering solutions for a greener future.  
                Allgemein ist das Unternehmenskonzept gänzlich unabhängig von Alter und Geschlecht für
                alle Menschen offen, Greenergym setzt jedoch einen verstärkten Fokus auf eine junge
                Zielgruppe, da sich besonders dort ein stärkerer Hang zur Nachhaltigkeit und
                Umweltbewusstsein ausprägt und gleichzeitig das höchste Potential für körperliche und
                sportliche Aktivität besteht.

            <h3> Information Architechture & Wireframing </h3>
            <p> 
                First, we determined the crucial screens and functionalities for the Mobile App based on User Flows. 
                Next, we developed a detailed information architecture, followed by the creation of wireframes 
                for the identified screens. 
                The graphic below provides a summary of these steps, which serve as the foundation upon which we constructed the app's design.
            
            </p>
            <!--<ul>
                <li> User Registration/Login: Users can create a new account or log in using their email or social media credentials.</li>
                <li> Tutorial: A brief tutorial introduces the app's features and benefits.</li>
                <li> Home Screen: Serves as a dashboard, displaying progress towards energy generation goals, upcoming workouts, daily statistics, and featured restaurant dishes.</li>

                <li> Restaurant Menu: Users can view daily restaurant menu offerings, including nutritional information, and place orders for pickup or delivery.</li>

                            The cardio tracking feature allows users to connect to a cardio machine in the gym and see live measurements of various parameters, which are later saved into the statistics section in their profile.
                            After scanning the QR-code on the respective machine, the app starts tracking the cardio workout.
                            If the user clicks on the Pause-button, any menu item or the arrow back, the app  will direct the user to a different screen after confirmation to proceed. i
                            In this case the tracking will be stopped.
                            The feature is accessed by pressing the green "+" Button in the menu or selecting "Cardio" in the workout selection.
