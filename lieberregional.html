            <p class="absatz"> 
                "Lieber Regional" is the outcome of our concluding project in the "Cross Media Marketing" module, which I opted for as an elective 
                during my studies. Our assignment was to develop a cross-media marketing image campaign aimed at enhancing awareness of local farmers 
                and increasing their sales, with a strong emphasis on encouraging local purchases. The directive was to promote this idea through a
                digital weekly market and to generate content for a minimum of two distinct media channels, concluding with a campaign pitch as our final presentation.

            <h4 class="role"> Roles</h4>
            <p class="absatz">
                As a team, we collaborated to develop the brand strategy and campaign concept, outlining the overall framework for our campaign content. 
                While my teammates concentrated on detailed strategic planning, the design of printed materials, and essential project documentation, 
                my focus centered on refining the app concept and ultimately creating the final designs for both the website and app. 
                Given these clearly defined responsibilities, and given my specific charge of the digital representation for the Wochenmarkt, 
                I'll primarily provide a more detailed account of its development here.

                    <h3> Strategic Foundation</h3>
                    <p> 
                        Initially, we developed a brand strategy to define our digital weekly marketplace's core values and vision, 
                        shaping its identity, positioning, and audience engagement. 
                        Then, we pinpointed campaign objectives and our target audience, constructing two personas for clarity. 
                        On this foundation, we shaped a unified campaign message and slogan for a compelling narrative.

                    <p> 
                        In the second phase, we carefully selected media channels for extended campaign reach. 
                        A strategic distribution and timing plan aimed for maximum engagement across platforms. 
                        For our chosen channels (offline posters, an online shop via website and app, and YouTube ads), 
                        we collectively formulated a well-defined direction 
                        for content development.

                    <p>

                        In the concluding phase, we created the content and visual elements for our chosen channels
                        to bring the campaign to life. 
                        This included designing print media, conceptualizing YouTube ads, creating the concept and user interface 
                        for both a mobile app and a website for the digital marketplace. 
                        The integration of campaign elements ensured consistent messaging across channels.

            <p> 
                The pitch deck showcases key campaign elements: strategic planning, media planning, and a snippet of the content we developed, 
                meaning the posters and a website/app design example. Note, this is just a fraction of our work. We've also developed a full app, 
                website, and a YouTube Ads concept, not featured in the deck.
                For this reason and due to my role developing the digital media content, I'll explore content development for YouTube, offline ads, 
                the app and website further down.

                Our campaign video for YouTube Ads features three interconnected storylines that converge at the end. 
                The storyboard is to visualize the general idea of the spot as we did not execute this in the scope of our
                project but wanted to convey the idea to create a comprehensive/cohesive storytelling.

            <h4 class="role"> Narrative Context</h4>
            <p> Jürgen, our protagonist, is a local small-scale farmer who leads a tightly scheduled routine on his 
                agricultural farm. While he is passionate about his profession, it also presents significant challenges for him,
                as he has to sacrifice most of his free time. Constantly under the pressure of securing his livelihood, he struggles to unwind and 
                establish a balanced work-life equation. On the other hand, our second protagonist Sarah leads a typical consumenten lifestyle of the typical
                consumer, not really worrying about her.

                Our poster design aimed to convey the theme of regional growth and unity through the vibrant imagery of thriving saplings, complemented by our core message, 
                "Regional gemeinsam wachsen" (Growing together regionally). 
                We took an approach of simplicity in design, making the message more accessible, memorable, and effective - particularily crucial for outdoor posters,
                that are displayed in environments where attention is fleeting and visual competition is intense.
               
            </p>
                
            <p class="absatz">
                Our simple yet captivating poster design, that is created to appeal to the emotions of the target audience, 
                aligns with these principles, reducing cognitive load and capturing attention effectively. 
                Through this approach, we maximized the impact of outdoor advertising. Additionally, we maintained brand identity by incorporating the logo. 
                This process seamlessly extended our campaign's coherent storytelling, resonating powerfully with our target audience.

                Our main project focus was on an extensive cross-media marketing campaign rather than fully developing our website and app. 
                Thus, we collaboratively decided to only create detailed visualizations for the most important screens of the app in our wireframes,
                 to streamline our work. For the remaining screens, we provided concise descriptions to convey the overall concept.

            </p>
            <p class="absatz">
                Given the greater complexity of our app concept compared to that of our website, where we simplified the marketplace 
                by consolidating functions onto a single page, we chose to present the app's information architecture exclusively in this context.

                    <p> 
                        With "Lieber Regional," we've successfully crafted a robust brand identity, compelling campaign content, 
                        and an engaging app and website concept to support local farmers, all of which have recieved  
                        positive feedback.
                    </p>

                    <p class="absatz">
                        However, in hindsight, we've identified areas for improvement in both our campaign and brand concept. In terms of our 
                        printed materials, producing only one version of the poster, as they are essentially identical except for the images, 
                        would have been a more cost-effective choice. Our media planning, constrained by budget considerations, 
                        could have been more meticulous, and we didn't fully elaborate on the product delivery concept.
                    </p>

                    <p class="absatz">
                        While we aspired to create a Lieferando-style platform, we recognized that implementing a centralized delivery system 
                        would necessitate additional resources. Consequently, we entrusted the delivery responsibility to individual farms, 
                        which could potentially lead to logistical challenges if not carefully coordinated. (Varied delivery times could lead 
                        to environmental or financial concerns, and deciding how to cover these costs without burdening customers or farmers 
                        could prove challenging).

                    </p>
                    <p class="absatz">
                        These challenges posed obstacles to unlocking the campaign's full potential. 
                        Meeting these conditions would pave the way for realizing the campaign's maximum impact.

                    <p class="absatz">
                        The concept of the "Regional gemeinsam wachsen" campaign remains realistically attainable. 
                        However, it would require a more detailed financial and budget planning process. 
                        Assuming "Lieber Regional" as the platform, it may be feasible, but conducting a comprehensive assessment 
                        of the financial aspect is crucial. We take pride in our achievement of crafting tailored and creative campaign 
                        content, which we firmly believe would strongly resonate with the target audience if launched successfully.
